At Lifestyle Garden Maintenance we treat any personal information that we collect as a result of enquiries, requests etc. with the strictest professionalism and confidence.

Personal information is not entered on our customer database without your consent. Customer details are only entered onto our database upon submitting an enquiry. This information does not get sold or distributed onto any other party, except for contracted suppliers responsible for delivering communications on our behalf. This is a one-off usage and the database is not retained by the supplier.

We do not distribute your e-mail address to other companies or organisations without your authorisation. If you supply us with your postal address, email address, or phone number you may receive periodic communications from us with information on new services.
