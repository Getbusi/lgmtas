Well what a wet and cold start to winter, but a needed one. If you have an early spring garden you will notice some bulbs poking their heads already like i have. That means it's a good time to put a slow release fertilizer on to the ground just to help them along.

You also might notice some different types coming through that you have not seen before some bulbs need a good cold start to get them moving. On previous years the ground has stayed warm which slows there growth down quite a bit. So happy gardening and stay tuned for more garden tips.
