As a tenant you may have a responsibility to care for the garden of the property you are renting. Lifestyle garden maintenance can take the stress and strain away of property inspections and also make sure that you do not have any problems with your landlord and bond returns.

Large or small propertiesâ€¦ we do the lot.
